1.  Introduction                                *piecrust-intro*

PieCrust is a static website generator and lightweight CMS. You can learn more
about it on the official website:

When a file from a PieCrust website is open in a buffer, that buffer gets new
commands defined.

2.  Introduction                                *piecrust-commands*

All commands defined by |piecrust| are local to each buffer.

                                                *Pcedit*
:Pcedit {args}          Opens a page, post or template file from the current
                        website given a website relative path.
                        The given {args} can be a part of the wanted file's
                        name, a glob pattern, or a regex pattern. In that case,
                        the auto-completion will provide the appropriate
                        matching files.
